## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project on your local computer up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
1. If you don't have an account already, create a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/s-cabrera/Anime-Q.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy to Heroku following these steps

   a. Open up a terminal in your project's root folder and install Heroku. If already installed, skip this step and go to step _b_
     ```sh
      npm install -g heroku
      ```
   b. Login to Heroku. Type the following demand in the terminal: 
    ```sh
    heroku login
    ```
   This will open up a browser for you to login to your Heroku account.
   
   c. Create an empty app to deploy on Heroku
     ```sh
        heroku create
      ```
   d. Deploy to Heroku by typing this command in the terminal
      ```sh
        git push heroku main
      ```
   e. If you encounter any errors, follow these link for guidance: [Installing](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) & [Deploying to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)
   
   f. Now that your application has been deployed, go to your account on Heroku and follow these steps below:
   
    * Look for your app and double-click it. Heroku will redirect you to your app's Overview section.
    
    * Click on the Resources tab on the navigation bar, look for the _Find more add-ons_ button.
    
    * Heroku will redirect you to the add-ons page. Search and install the JawsDB MySQL.
    
   <!-- ![JawsDB][jawsDB] -->
   
   g. If you check out the app on Heroku, it should have none of the animes displayed. Don't despair. You just need to seed the JawsDB by running this command in your terminal: 
   ```sh
   heroku npm run seeds/Anime_500.js
   ```
